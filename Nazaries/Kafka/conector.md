To create an MQTT-Kafka source connector using Docker, you will need to have Docker installed on your system and have a Docker container running with Kafka and Mosquitto (MQTT) already installed.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can follow these steps to create the MQTT-Kafka source connector:

Use the following Docker command to connect to the Docker container where Kafka and Mosquitto are running:

Copy code
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
Inside the Docker container, use the following Kafka Connect CLI command to create a configuration file for the MQTT-Kafka source connector:

Copy code
echo "name=mqtt-source-connector
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.mqtt.MqttSourceConnector
tasks.max=1
mqtt.server.uri=tcp://<mqtt_broker_hostname>:<mqtt_broker_port>
kafka.topic=<kafka_topic_name>
mqtt.client.id=<mqtt_client_id>
mqtt.qos=1" > mqtt-source.properties
This configuration file specifies the connection details for the MQTT and Kafka brokers, as well as the topics to be used for publishing and subscribing to messages.

Use the following Kafka Connect CLI command to start the MQTT-Kafka source connector using the configuration file you created in the previous step:

Copy code
connect-standalone /etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-standalone.properties mqtt-source.properties
Use the following Mosquitto client command to create a publisher client that connects to the MQTT broker and publishes a message on the specified topic:

Copy code
mosquitto_pub -h <mqtt_broker_hostname> -p <mqtt_broker_port> -t <mqtt_topic> -m "Hello from MQTT!"
Use the following Kafka consumer API code to create a consumer client that subscribes to the specified topic on the Kafka broker. This consumer client will receive all the messages published on the topic by the MQTT publisher:

Copy code
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    "<kafka_topic_name>",
    bootstrap_servers=["<kafka_broker_hostname>:<kafka_broker_port>"],
    auto_offset_reset="earliest",
    enable_auto_commit=True,
    group_id="<consumer_group_id>"
)

for message in consumer:
    print(message.value)
Alternatively, you can also use the MQTT broker itself to receive the messages published on the Kafka broker. To do this, you can use the following Mosquitto client command to create a subscriber client that connects to the MQTT broker and subscribes to the specified topic:

Copy code
mosquitto_sub -h <mqtt_broker_hostname> -p <mqtt_broker_port> -t <mqtt_topic>
